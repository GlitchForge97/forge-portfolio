# Forge Portfolio

A portfolio where design and craft intersect. Built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—no frameworks, no bloat. Just intentional code that performs.

## About

This is a living showcase of projects, ideas, and technical growth. Each interaction is deliberate. Each animation serves a purpose. It's designed to feel responsive and human, not corporate.

## What's Inside

- **Hero** — A snapshot of what drives the work
- **Experience** — The journey, milestone by milestone  
- **Skills** — Core competencies visualized intuitively
- **Projects** — Work that matters, with context and results
- **Certifications** — Credibility through continuous learning
- **Contact** — A simple way to start a conversation

## Technical

- Works in all modern browsers

## Deploy

```bash

The code is clean. The design is timeless. It says what it needs to say, nothing more.
